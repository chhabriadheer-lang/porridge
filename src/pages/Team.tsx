              A Message from Our Founders
            </h2>

              <p>
                We started Porridge Ventures because we kept meeting brilliant founders with bold ideas — the kind that could reshape industries — but they were building without the brand and creative firepower their vision deserved.
Agencies were too expensive. Freelancers too inconsistent. And hiring senior creative leaders too early could burn through precious runway before product-market fit.
So we built a different model — one rooted in partnership, not transactions. At Porridge, we trade our branding and strategic expertise for equity. That means we only win when you do. We don’t think like service providers; we think like co-founders.
We know the challenges of early-stage building — the uncertainty, the trade-offs, the need to make every decision count. That’s exactly where we come in.
Porridge exists to give early-stage founders the creative advantage they need to build enduring brands — without losing focus, control, or cash flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional agencies price out early-stage startups. Freelancers lack the strategic
                depth and consistency. And hiring full-time creative leaders too early can drain your
                runway before you've found product-market fit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our model is simple: we take equity instead of cash, aligning our success with yours.
                This isn't just about making brand work affordable—it's about making us true partners
                in your journey. When we have skin in the game, we think like co-founders, not vendors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've built brands, scaled marketing teams, and raised capital ourselves. We know the
                challenges you face because we've lived them. And we're here to help you navigate them
                with the creative excellence your vision deserves.
